# Online Gaming Behavior – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an online gaming behavior dataset to understand player engagement patterns, gameplay activities, and key factors influencing user behavior.

The analysis focuses on identifying trends, relationships, and insights from player activity data using statistical methods and visualizations.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about players, including:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
- Gameplay behavior (PlayTimeHours, SessionsPerWeek, AvgSessionDuration)
- Progression metrics (PlayerLevel, AchievementsUnlocked)
- Monetization behavior (InGamePurchases)
- Engagement classification (EngagementLevel)

The dataset is clean with **no missing values or duplicate records**.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and inspection  
- Descriptive statistical analysis  
- Group-wise analysis using `groupby()`  
- Outlier detection using the IQR method  
- Univariate and bivariate visualizations  
- Correlation analysis  
- Engagement-level comparison  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
